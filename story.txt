Title: The Galactic Adventure

Dear Barbie,

I am writing to you from a [2] spaceship in a [3] galaxy. I found myself here one day after
going for a ride on a [4] rocket in [5]. There are [6] [7] and [8] of [9] here! In the
[10] there is a pool full of water. I fall asleep each night on a beautiful bed of
wood and dream of singing slowly. It feels as though I have lived here for
420 galactic years. I hope one day you can visit, although the only way to get here now is
drowning on a tripping tricycle!!

Best wishes,
Oppenheimer
